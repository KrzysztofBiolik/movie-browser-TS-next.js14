MoviesBrowser is a huge collection of the most interesting movies and most popular actors. It is an intuitive browser that uses the TMDB database. I have adapted it so that you can use it on any screen:

- large screen

- medium screen

- small screen

Movie Browser gives you the ability to not only browse information about available movies or actors, but you can also search for the title or actor's name that interests you using the search engine at the top of the screen.
